# Still-No-Guts
A "Choose Your Own Adventure" game about someone who apparently never got guts. 
*To launch the game, start "Still No Guts.exe" located in "(...)\Still No Guts\bin\Release\net7.0"*

This is the enhanced, remastered, or however you wanna call it, "No Guts" project I made for my final examination project, which was used to evaluate my programming skills, by my trainers.
You can find it here: https://github.com/Ciocolici/No-Guts-CSharp-Console-App

I wasn't fully happy with my original "No Guts", so I fully remade it in "Still No Guts". It is fully translated into english, has more choices, ASCII pictures, looks better (colorful and better organized), and is a better "experience" overall. :D
It has been made in Console App, by someone who is aspiring to become a real programmer someday. And it is his (mine) first big (bigger) project.
