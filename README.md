# Still No Guts

A "Choose Your Own Adventure" game about someone who apparently never had guts... until now? ðŸ«£

*To run the Console App program directly, launch `Still No Guts.exe` located in `bin\Release\net7.0\`.*

This is the enhanced, remastered, and fully reworked version of my original "[No Guts](https://github.com/Ciocolici/No-Guts-CSharp-Console-App)" project, which was my final examination project, evaluated by trainers at Lutz + Grub Academy. This version is fully translated into English, contains more branching storylines, humor, ASCII art, and colorful console interactions.

You play as an awkward but lovable main character navigating an ordinary workday, but everything goes hilariously wrong depending on his **self-esteem level**, a key stat that affects nearly every choice you make.

### Highlights
- Written in pure C# as a .NET Console Application
- Branching decisions based on player input
- ASCII art for characters and events
- Dialogue-driven storytelling
- State logic tied to player stats (self-esteem system)
- Fully interactive with multiple endings

This project was a fun challenge and also my first bigger personal project.  
Itâ€™s a combination of coding practice and storytelling, a passion project that grew from a simple exercise into something Iâ€™m proud of.

> The code was entirely written by me.
